* Rockchip RK3308 Internal Codec

Required properties:

- compatible: "rockchip,rk3308-codec"
- reg: The physical base address of the controller and length of memory
  mapped region.
- rockchip,grf: The phandle of the syscon node for GRF register.
- clocks: A list of phandle + clock-specifer pairs, one for each entry in
  clock-names.
- clock-names: It should be "acodec".
- resets : Must contain an entry for each entry in reset-names.
- reset-names : Must include the following entries: "acodec-reset".

Optional properties:
- rockchip,adc-grps: This is a variable length array, that shows the mapping of
  the configuration adc grp. The following shows the relationship between grp
  and ADC:
  * grp 0 -- select ADC1 / ADC2
  * grp 1 -- select ADC3 / ADC4
  * grp 2 -- select ADC5 / ADC6
  * grp 3 -- select ADC7 / ADC8
  By default, they are all enabled, like using:
  - rockchip,adc-grps = <0 1 2 3>;
  If we don't use ADC5 and ADC6, we just use grp 0,1,3 on dts. For example:
  - rockchip,adc-grps = <0 1 3>;

- rockchip,loopback-grp: It points out the ADC group which is the loopback used.
- hp-ctl-gpios: The gpio of head phone controller.
- spk-ctl-gpios: The gpio of speak controller.

Example for rk3308 internal codec:

acodec: acodec@ff560000 {
	compatible = "rockchip,rk3308-codec";
	reg = <0x0 0xff560000 0x0 0x10000>;
	rockchip,grf = <&grf>;
	clocks = <&cru PCLK_ACODEC>;
	clock-names = "acodec";
	resets = <&cru SRST_ACODEC_P>;
	reset-names = "acodec-reset";
	rockchip,loopback-grp = <0>;
	hp-ctl-gpios = <&gpio0 1 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
	spk-ctl-gpios = <&gpio0 5 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
	status = "okay";
};
